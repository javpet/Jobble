## Inspiration
The inspiration came after we gained some insights about the current situation in Madagascar, Zambia, Uganda, Ethiopia and other developing countries in Africa 🌍, where citizens are still using mostly featured phones in their everyday lives, so sending messages for good and services is sometimes the only option for them.📱

## What it does
Jobble provides job listing and finding service for the emerging world via our unique Jobble SMS bot which combines locations and jobs filters to match the best applicants with the right opportunity.

## How we built it
We set up the heart of our SMS bot in python 🐍 environment and connected to our god Twilio number to accept messages from users (possible job seekers and employers) from the emerging world.

## Challenges we ran into
We've some challenges properly connecting the Twilio API at first and we experienced some freezes in the communication as well.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our concept which might help to solve the unemployment issue on the job markets in Africa connecting the supply and demand in a way they both familiar with.

## What we learned
We've learned a lot of these people everyday lives during the insight gathering and we needed to drop a lot of ideas 🤓
